   - **Complete Sentence**: When a person pedals the bicycle, their muscular force pushes the pedals, propelling the bicycle forward.

2. **Example 2**:  
   - **External Agent**: A child
   - **Object**: A toy car
   - **Push/Pull**: The child **pulls** the toy car towards them.
   - **Complete Sentence**: The child uses their muscular force to pull the toy car across the floor.

3. **Example 3**:  
   - **External Agent**: An athlete
   - **Object**: A shot put
   - **Push/Pull**: The athlete **pushes** the shot put during the throw.
   - **Complete Sentence**: The athlete exerts muscular force to push the shot put forward, launching it into the air.

## 2. Mechanical Force

**Definition**:  
**Mechanical force** is a push or pull applied by machines on an object, altering its state of motion, direction, or shape.

### Examples

1. **Example 1**:  
   - **External Agent**: A forklift
   - **Object**: A heavy crate
   - **Push/Pull**: The forklift **pulls** the crate upward.
   - **Complete Sentence**: The forklift exerts a mechanical force to lift the heavy crate, raising it off the ground.

2. **Example 2**:  
   - **External Agent**: A car engine
   - **Object**: The car itself
   - **Push/Pull**: The engine **pushes** the car forward.
   - **Complete Sentence**: The car's engine provides mechanical force that pushes the vehicle down the road.

3. **Example 3**:  
   - **External Agent**: A lever
   - **Object**: A heavy rock
   - **Push/Pull**: The lever **pushes** the rock up.
   - **Complete Sentence**: Using a lever, a person applies mechanical force to push the heavy rock off the ground.

## 3. Gravitational Force

**Definition**:  
**Gravitational force** is a pull exerted by the Earth (or another massive object) on an object, affecting its state of motion, direction, or shape.

### Examples

1. **Example 1**:  
   - **External Agent**: The Earth
   - **Object**: An apple
   - **Push/Pull**: The Earth **pulls** the apple downward.
   - **Complete Sentence**: When the apple detaches from the tree, the gravitational force pulls it toward the ground.

2. **Example 2**:  
   - **External Agent**: The Earth
   - **Object**: A dropped ball
   - **Push/Pull**: The Earth **pulls** the ball towards itself.
   - **Complete Sentence**: The gravitational force causes the dropped ball to fall straight down to the ground.

3. **Example 3**:  
   - **External Agent**: The Earth
   - **Object**: A person standing on a scale
   - **Push/Pull**: The Earth **pulls** the person down.
   - **Complete Sentence**: The gravitational force pulls the person down, and the scale shows their weight.

## 4. Magnetic Force

**Definition**:  
**Magnetic force** is a push or pull exerted by magnets on magnetic materials, which can change the state of motion, direction, or shape of the object.

### Examples

1. **Example 1**:  
   - **External Agent**: A magnet
   - **Object**: A paperclip
   - **Push/Pull**: The magnet **pulls** the paperclip towards itself.
   - **Complete Sentence**: The magnet exerts a magnetic force that pulls the paperclip toward it, causing it to stick.

2. **Example 2**:  
   - **External Agent**: A bar magnet
   - **Object**: Iron filings
   - **Push/Pull**: The magnet **pulls** the iron filings into a pattern.
   - **Complete Sentence**: The bar magnet exerts a magnetic pull on the iron filings, arranging them into a visible pattern.

3. **Example 3**:  
   - **External Agent**: A magnetic crane
   - **Object**: Scrap metal
   - **Push/Pull**: The crane **pulls** the metal pieces up.
   - **Complete Sentence**: The magnetic crane uses magnetic force to pull the scrap metal pieces off the ground.

## 5. Electrostatic/Electric Force

**Definition**:  
**Electrostatic (electric) force** is a push or pull between charged objects, which can change the state of motion, direction, or shape of the object.

### Examples

1. **Example 1**:  
   - **External Agent**: A charged balloon
   - **Object**: Small pieces of paper
   - **Push/Pull**: The balloon **pulls** the paper pieces toward itself.
   - **Complete Sentence**: When the charged balloon is brought near the paper, the electrostatic force pulls the paper towards the balloon.

2. **Example 2**:  
   - **External Agent**: A charged comb
   - **Object**: Hair strands
   - **Push/Pull**: The comb **pulls** the hair strands toward it.
   - **Complete Sentence**: The charged comb exerts electrostatic force, pulling the hair strands towards it after being rubbed against a wool cloth.

## 6. Consequential Force

**Definition**:  
**Consequential force** is a force that occurs as a result of one or more other forces, creating a chain reaction that can change an objectâ€™s motion, direction, or shape.

### Examples

1. **Example 1**:  
   - **External Agent**: A falling bowling ball
   - **Object**: Bowling pins
   - **Push/Pull**: The bowling ball **pushes** the pins when it strikes them.
